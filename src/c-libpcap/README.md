# Packet Sniffer - C Implementation (using `libpcap`)

Packet Sniffer, implemented in C, using `libpcap`. Can capture both in promiscuous mode (for the entire network) and normal mode (just for your machine).

For now, dumps everything to console but support for dumping to files will be added soon!
