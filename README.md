# Packet Sniffer

Packet Sniffers implemented in various languages!

*Just for learning purposes.*

## Implementations

### C Implementation (Raw Sockets)

This version uses raw sockets (in promiscuous mode) to sniff packets in a network. The program can also be run just to capture packets on a machine (not in promiscuous mode).

### C Implementation (with `libpcap`)

*Upcoming*

### Ruby Implementation
